### **Code Quality Enhancements Added**

#### **1. Comprehensive Documentation**
- **File-level comments**: Detailed purpose and responsibility descriptions
- **Class documentation**: Clear role and interaction explanations  
- **Method comments**: Parameter descriptions and return value details
- **Inline comments**: Logic explanations and implementation notes
- **Future enhancement notes**: Suggestions for extensibility

#### **2. Code Organization**
- **Section headers**: Logical grouping of related methods and properties
- **Consistent formatting**: Standardized indentation and spacing
- **Clear naming**: Descriptive variable and method names
- **Separation of concerns**: Clean architecture with single responsibilities

#### **3. Maintainability Features**

- **Performance optimization**: Efficient algorithms and minimal rebuilds

### **Key Technical Implementations**

#### **State Management (GameState)**
```dart
/// GameState class manages all game logic and state for the Hangman game
/// Uses ChangeNotifier to provide reactive updates to the UI when state changes
class GameState extends ChangeNotifier {
  // 50+ word bank with programming terms
  // Efficient Set-based letter tracking
  // Comprehensive game state management
  // Real-time win/loss condition checking
}
```

#### **UI Components**
- **AlphabetGrid**: 7x4 responsive grid with color-coded button states
- **WordDisplay**: Real-time progress with monospace letter alignment
- **GameStatusCard**: Animated win/lose messages with emoji integration
- **WrongGuessCounter**: Dual counter display with visual indicators

#### **Reactive UI Updates**
```dart
// Consumer pattern for efficient state listening
Consumer<GameState>(
  builder: (context, gameState, child) {
    // UI rebuilds only when GameState changes
    // Targeted updates minimize performance impact
  }
)
```
